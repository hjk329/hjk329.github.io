안녕하세요오 :)
공부하고 배운 것들을 기록하는 블로그입니다 📚🐶💗

Hello World :) <br>
I'm Korea based software engineer, primarily working on frontend development using Javascript, Typescript, Next.js, React.js, CSS3, and HTML5. <br>
I believe having ***WHY questions*** is quite important to be a successful software engineer. <br>
This blog is a place to explore those "why questions" thoroughly.
